# Short description of the bot
description = "A tactical 1v1-focused RLBot built on GoslingUtils that blends smart shot selection, timed aerial intercepts, and momentum-efficient movement. It evaluates threat, picks future intercept points it can realistically reach, and visualizes its plan with rich in-game debug overlays (intercept circles, shot arrows, and ball flight paths)."

# Fun fact about the bot
fun_fact = "It “thinks ahead” in the air—choosing aerial intercept points that are late enough to be reachable, so it arrives on time instead of jumping early and missing."
